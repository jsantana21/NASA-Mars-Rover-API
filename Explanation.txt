Time Spent on the Coding Solution: Approx. 2 hours 30 mins

Pros:
    I was able to make a fetch request to the NASA Mars Rover API to recieve 
    the navigation camera images from the curiosity rover from the last 10 days and keep the images to 3 per day.
    Though I had to make multiple fecth calls to the API in a for loop as I wasn't able to figure how to cache the 
    JSON information in the local storage of the browser.
    
Room for Improvement:
     I struggled trying to make my code not be so repetitive and tried to do so by implementing a cache layer to my API as
     expected though I didn't know how to go about doing so. I also ran into trouble handling the undefined error in the case that 
     the rover hasn't taken 3 pictures so the API can only output JSON with exactly 3 images.
